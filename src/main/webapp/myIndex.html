	<h1>Welcome to the Creager Family Tree</h1>
	This site is dedicated to capturing updates to the our version of the
	Book of Creager and is primarily intended<br>for the use of Descendents of
	Henry and Lovina Stockwell Creager.
	<br>
	<br>As many of you know, our Book of Creager was originally created in
	1904-05 by the children of Henry and Lovinia.
	<br>In 1982 the children of Thomas anad Helen Creager produced an update.
	<b>At this point another update is long past due.</b>
	<br><br>The purpose of
	this site is to facilitate the collection of information for that
	update and to make it available to all when it is in a distributable
	form.
	<br>
	<br> If you have already recorded this information in some
	electronic form (e.g. Ancestry.com, some other site, or in a desktop
	package)
	<br>please feel free to provide an electronic download and I'll
	incorporate your information directly.
	<br>To discuss in more detail, please feel free to
	<a
		href="mailto:dcreager@coca-cola.com?Subject=Family%20Tree%20Integration">mail</a>
	or
	<a href="tel:4048031794">call</a> me directly.
	<br>
	<br>For those who do not have electronic records, I have adapted
	an electronic version of Ancestry.com's
	<b>Family Group Record</b> to 
	<br>facilitate gathering our updates for this book.
	<br>
	<br>One final note,
	<B>please overlook the extremely basic design of this site.</B>
	<br> It is a means to an end and I don't have the time to be too
	concerned about it's 'look and feel'.  
	<br>Time will tell if it ever evolves into something more 'elegant'.
	<br>For now, I just want it to get the job done!
	<br>
	<br> Thank you for your patience, cooperation and assistance!
	<br>
	<br> Daniel R. Creager, Aug 2015
