# FamilyTree
Family Tree is a basic Genealogy Site for collecting and maintaining the basic data that comprises a family tree. It is also a technology research project.  Rather than implementing a simple web application using J2EE technology, as was indicated by the application requirements, this implementation will utilize containers and microservices to make it application highly scalable as a cloud based deployment.  Additionally, it will be supported by automated Testing and a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipeline that will be implemented as part of the research project.
