# FamilyTree
Family Tree is a basic Genealogy Site for collecting and maintaining the basic data that comprises a family tree.  
It is also a personal research project.  Rather than implementing a simple web application using J2EE technology, 
as was my original intention, this implementation will utilize containers and microservices to make it application highly scalable as a cloud based deployment.
